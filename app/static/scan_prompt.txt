CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Output MUST be ONLY the JSON object.
STRICTLY do not include any explanation, questions and advice
outside of the JSON structure itself. ONLY the JSON object
is allowed as the output. Check that the JSON object syntax is valid.

Analyze the food image. Determine the meal name, ingredients list,
and estimate the Calories, Proteins, Fats, and Carbohydrates for the
amount of meal shown on the picture.

The variables values (except for 'status') must be in Russian language.

Use the following structure and data types:

{
    "meal_name": str,
    "ingredients": list[str],
    "calories": int,
    "proteins": int,
    "fats": int,
    "carbohydrates": int,
    "status": "ok"
}

Do not use code blocks, just return plain text of JSON

If the picture does not contain food, return
{"status": "fail"}
